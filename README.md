# Book_my_show


## Description:

The Book My Show Backend Application is a web-based application built using the Spring Boot framework, Java programming language,
MySQL database, Hibernate ORM, JPA (Java Persistence API), and Swagger/Postman. The application is designed to manage all Book My 
Show operations, including adding users, theaters, shows, movies, booking tickets, and getting all shows by movie.

The application consists of multiple RESTful APIs that are designed to be user-friendly and easy to use. These APIs include adding 
users, adding theaters, adding shows, adding movies, booking tickets, and getting all shows by movie.

Additionally, an email integration feature has been added to the system, which sends an email to the user when a ticket is booked.
This feature enhances the user experience by providing real-time information about their bookings.

The project is structured using Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) and Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture. This structure enables
efficient communication between the server and client and streamlines the development process. DTOs are used to transfer data 
between layers, and MVC is used to separate business logic from presentation logic.

The project also uses Swagger/Postman to document and test the RESTful APIs. This provides a standardized way of accessing and 
manipulating data and ensures that the APIs are consistent and reliable.
